skipping part on customer orders in chapter 7 - won't be useful to my idea or project (page 281)
Not worrying about saving orders into my database. Also installed Celery as required in the chapter but went through
setup steps and actually using Celery but ultimately decided to skip this because again, it isn't relevant to my idea
or project (nor will it really be useful anywhere else besides chapter 7)
